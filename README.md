# screentint
A simple BASH script to help you change the tint of your desktop.

There is some evidence that the blue tint of most devices such as phones, tablets and laptops can interfere with sleep patterns. You may be able to reduce this effect by changing the tint balance of your screen. Screentint is a simple way to do that on your laptop.

There are two versions:
* simplescreentint.sh is a command-line script
* screentint.sh uses the listgen library to make a graphical display
